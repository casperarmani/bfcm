Here's a detailed plan to enhance our session handling without breaking existing functionality:

True Sliding Window Implementation
Track both creation time and last access time for each session
Implement two timeouts: absolute maximum session duration and sliding window duration
Update last access time on meaningful user interactions
Store these timestamps in Redis with the session data
Cookie Refresh Mechanism
Add middleware to intercept all authenticated requests
Check if session is approaching refresh threshold
Issue new cookie with updated expiration on qualified requests
Maintain session-cookie synchronization
Handle race conditions for multiple concurrent requests
Maximum Session Duration
Add configuration for absolute maximum session length (e.g., 24 hours)
Track initial session creation time
Force logout when maximum duration is reached
Provide warning notifications before forced expiration
Handle graceful data saving before session expiration
Session Extension Logic
Define rules for when sessions can be extended
Implement extension blacklist for sensitive operations
Add rate limiting for session refreshes
Track number of extensions per session
Handle extension failures gracefully
Graceful Degradation
Implement retry logic for failed refresh attempts
Add fallback mechanisms for Redis connectivity issues
Queue failed operations for retry
Maintain client-side state during connectivity issues
Provide clear user feedback during degraded operations
Security Enhancements
Add session fingerprinting
Implement IP-based session validation
Add rate limiting for session operations
Track suspicious session patterns
Implement session revocation capabilities
Monitoring and Debugging
Add session lifecycle logging
Track session metrics (duration, refresh counts, etc.)
Monitor failed refresh attempts
Track session cleanup operations
Add debugging endpoints for session status
Client-Side Improvements
Implement proactive session refresh
Add session status indicators
Handle multiple tabs/windows
Manage offline scenarios
Provide session expiration warnings
This can be implemented in phases:

Core sliding window implementation
Security enhancements
Monitoring and debugging
Client-side improvements
